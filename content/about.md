I am a Machine Learning Engineer currently working as a Principal World Wide Specialist Solutions Architect at AWS. My recent focus has been on foundation model training and deployment, particularly optimizing workflows on Slurm and Kubernetes.

I am passionate about open source and spend a significant portion of my time contributing to projects like [AWSome Distributed Training](https://github.com/aws-samples/awsome-distributed-training), which helps developers optimize their foundation model training workloads on AWS.
